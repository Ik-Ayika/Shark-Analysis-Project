# Shark_Project
I will be conducting an analysis on shark attacks reported over the past 100 years, including location, activity, victim info (name, gender, age), shark species, and so on. I will primarily be using the data to truly assess the validity of these cases as well as the true data that sharks pose. I quote the Loyola-resident Shark Expert, Avalon Butler, of whom is totally unbiased (as much as she is beautiful), in the report as well to give commentary on the stigma that sharks have due to movies and shows. This report is to show that sharks are not the bully of the sea, but that humans might be, as well as some fun queries regarding sharks, the data, and, as a special surprise, a "Shark Week" themed analysis!
